My coding process has been consisting of a lot of google searches. I had a lot of trouble making Alpha maps work for some reason, and i had some problems trying to use WEBGL. Alpha maps didn't seem to work in WEBGL and i was unable to find any working solutions or even mentions of this problem. The reason i used WEBGL to begin with, was because of the different coordinate system i uses. It seemed perfect for what i had in mind, but i finally found a solution by trying out different mathematical setups.

A program is a coded function, which is stored in the memory of a digital artifact.

I see errors as a very natural part of using anything computer related. Wether you're playing games, programming, creating graphics or just browsing the internet, some part of the experience will often include dealing with errors. Internet culture contain a lot references to errors, glitches and noises because of their expression being very unique to the digital space. In indie games there's a subgenre of games called 'altgames' and they often use errors, glitches and noises.
