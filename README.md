My coding process has been consisting of a lot of google searches. I had a lot of trouble making Alpha maps work for some reason, and i had some problems trying to use WEBGL. Alpha maps didn't seem to work in WEBGL and i was unable to find any working solutions or even mentions of this problem. The reason i used WEBGL to begin with, was because of the different coordinate system i uses. It seemed perfect for what i had in mind, but i finally found a solution by trying out different mathematical setups.

A program is a coded function, which is stored in the memory of a digital artifact.
